= Client-server communications
    - MUST: Game reset on player logout
    - MUST: Game reset on player disconnect
    - SHOULD: Put token in session

= Game logic
	- MUST: Game reset
	- MUST: Should catch thrown exceptions and recover from them, instead of quitting the app
	- SHOULD: Count game statistics
    - NICE: Return shortest winning path
    - NICE: Multiple simultaneous games

= Game display
    - MUST: Replace winning path animation by cells "illumination", until Game logic can return shortest winning path
    - MUST: Re-ask for full game status when re-joining as viewer
    - MUST: Add "projector" view with QR code (and auto-join as viewer)
    - SHOULD: Add "about" dialog (presenting Bombora, the technical stack and possibly the game statistics)
    - SHOULD: Adapt CSS/SVG to all screen sizes
    - NICE: Enable/Disable animations based on user-agent
    - NICE: Sounds?
    
= General
	- SHOULD: Extend Jasmine/Angular-mock test coverage (using Karma and Istanbul?)
	- SHOULD: Improve server-side and client-side error handling
	- NICE: Logging

= Notes for winning move calculation
    - The game will never tie. You can only lose if your opponent has won, it is not possible to deadlock.
    - Other HexGame implementations highlight the entire path. If the winning path forks and joins, it is still part of the winning path, so highlight it all.
    - The winning move must involve the most recent move. So use that as a starting point for path-finding.
