    - Determine game success
    - Return winning path
    - Multiple simultaneous games?

= Game display
    - Branding

= Notes for winning move calculation
    - The game will never tie. You can only lose if your opponent has won, it is not possible to deadlock.
    - Other HexGame implementations highlight the entire path. If the winning path forks and joins, it is still part of the winning path, so highlight it all.
    - The winning move must involve the most recent move. So use that as a starting point for path-finding.
